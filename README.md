# SNS-Data-Analysis-with-K-Means-Clustering
The dataset collected used for clustering analysis with k-menas contains social networking service (SNS) information of 30000 anonymous U.S. high school students who had SNS profile in 2006. This dataset was compiled by Brett Lantz while conducting his sociological research on the teenage identities at the University of Notre Dame, and was used again as example in his book: Machine Learning with R (second edition) published by PACKT.
